# How to: Set up Email
To send and receive emails within Financials, you must fill in the fields in the **SMTP Mail Setup** window.

**Note**: Instead of entering the SMTP server details, you can select to have them prefilled from the email settings that are connected to your Office 365 subscription.

You can either set email up manually or you can get help by running the **Email Setup** assisted setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

## To set up email
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **SMTP Mail Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.
3. Close the window.
