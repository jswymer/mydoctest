# How to: Define Extended Text

You can extend a standard text by adding extra lines, and you can set up conditions for use of the extra lines. Before you do this, you must set up standard text codes.

## To define extended text for standard text codes
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Standard Text Codes**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Code** field, enter the code, and in the **Description** field, enter the desired text.
3. Choose **Extended Texts**.
4. Fill in the lines in the **Extended Text** window with the additional text.
5. Fill in the **Language Code** field or the **All Language Codes** field if you use language codes. 
6. Fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields if you want to limit the dates on which the extended text is used.
7. Select relevant check boxes for the document types where you want the extended text printed.
8. Choose the **OK** button.
