# Mandatory Fields
When you enter data on pages in Project "Madeira", certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process that uses the field, such as posting a transaction that uses the value in the field.

Even though the field contains a red asterisk, you are not forced to fill the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you will be blocked from completing a certain process.

## Examples
In the **Customer Card** window, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field, in the **Tax Area Code** field, and in the posting group fields to indicate that you cannot post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.

In the **Item Card** window, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** field to indicate that you cannot enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless this field is filled.
