# Welcome to Dynamics 365 for Financials

Financials is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Signing up is easy, and you can migrate existing business data from your legacy system.
When you have signed up for the Financials preview, you have access to a demonstration company. The demonstration company contains sample data, but you can create your own sales documents, for example, or set up a bank account.  

In the demonstration company, you can see visual guides that explain core functionality. These guides let you try out daily tasks such as making a sales invoice and viewing a report. When you want to explore Financials on your own, you can always go back to the Getting Started tour by launching it from the Home page.   

## The Home page
The Home page is where you will find the **Assisted Setup & Tasks** action. Here you see a list of assisted setup that can help you getting started. Once you have migrated data such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system using the **Migrate Business Data** assisted setup you are ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if the other assisted setup can help you.

In the **Assisted Setup** window, you will find the following:

|Assisted Setup           |Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Migrate Business Data    |Lets you import your existing company data such as vendors, customers, and items from Excel or Quickbooks.|
|Set Up My Company        |Creates a new trial company for you to enter data and try our Financials. If you went through the Getting Started tour this is probably already **Completed**.|
|Set Up Cash Flow Forecast|Sets up the Cash Flow Forecast chart, so you can view the predicted movement of cash in and out of your business. The chart is available on the **Accountant Role Center**.|
|Set Up Approval Workflows|Sets up the ability to automatically notify an approver when a user tries to create or change certain values on documents, journal lines, or cards, such as an amount above a specified limit.|
|Set Up a Customer Approval Workflow|Sets up the ability to automatically notify an approver when a user tries to create or change a customer card.|
|Set Up Email             |Gets you ready for sending email messages directly from, for example, sales orders or contacts in Financials.|
|Set Up Email Logging     |Sets up the capability to log email correspondence in Financials to follow up on interactions.|
|Set Up Outlook for Financials|Sets up the ability to use and launch Financials from Outlook.|
|Set Up Reporting         |Sets up data sets that you can use to build powerful reports using Excel or Power BI, for example.|
|Set Up and Item Approval Workflow|Sets up the ability to send a notification to an approver when a user changes or creates an item.|
|Set Up a Payment Approval Workflow|Sets up the ability to send a notification to an approver when a user sends payment journal lines for approval.|
|Set up Dynamics CRM connection|Sets up a connection between Dynamics CRM and Financials, so that you can synchronize date in the two services.|
|Set Up Sales Tax         |Gets you started with default Tax groups and assigning Tax area codes that you can assign to customers and vendors in order to automatically calculate sales tax in sales or purchase documents.|


|Set Up Dynamics CRM Connection|Sets up a connection to Dynamics CRM which allows you to synchronize data such as contacts and sales order information.|

When you have run an assisted setup, it is marked as **Completed**. To run the assisted setup, you choose the three dots also called the context menu, and then you select **Start Setup**.  

Depending on the experience that you have specified in your company settings, some or all of the assisted setups will appear.

## Get to know Financials
In Financials, some things will be familiar to you, and other things might be unfamiliar. To help you get to know Financials, we have a list of nice-to-know tricks, such as how to [find things](ui-search.md), how to [set filters](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md), or how to [sort data in lists](ui-sorting.md). For more information, see [Work With Dynamics 365 for Financials](ui-work-product.md).  

## Trying things out in your own company
Thinking about subscribing? You can easily change from the demonstration company, and create and work in a company of your own. This is a great way to start toward a subscription. Setups for finances are provided; you just need to create or import your items, customers, and vendors. After that, you're ready to post invoices for your actual customers, and use business intelligence tools to analyze your business. 

You can use your company for free for a 30-day trial period. If you subscribe to Financials during that time, you're already up and running. You can continue with the work you did during the trial.   

To create a company to try things out, go to the **My Settings** menu in the top right corner, and change the company to **My Company**. Sign out of Financials and then sign in again to apply the change. An assisted setup guide will help you provide basic information about your company.  

When that's done, explore the Home page and find the **Assisted Setup & Tasks** action. There you'll find more assisted setup guides for setting up additional features, such as email, reporting, and approval workflows.  

    **Tip:** The **Data Migration** assisted setup is particularly helpful for importing data from a variety of sources.
