# Welcome to Project "Madeira" 

Project "Madeira" is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Signing up is easy, and you can migrate existing business data from your legacy system.
When you have signed up for the Project "Madeira" preview, you have access to a trial version for a limited period. The trial version contains sample data, but you can create your own sales documents, for example, or set up a bank account.  

In the trial version, you can see visual guides that explain core functionality. These guides let you try out daily tasks such as making a sales invoice and viewing a report. When you want to explore Project "Madeira" on your own, you can always go back to the Getting Started tour by choosing **Activites** and then **Getting Started** on the Home page.   
  
The Home page is also where you will find the **Assisted Setup & Tasks** action. Here you see a list of assisted setup that can help you getting started. Once you have migrated data such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system using the **Migrate Business Data** assisted setup you are ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if the other assisted setup can help you. 

In the **Assisted Setup** window, you will find the following:

|Assisted Setup           |Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Set Up Company           |Creates a new trial company for you to enter data and try our Project "Madeira". If you went through the Getting Started tour this is probably already **Completed**. |
|Migrate Business Data    |Lets you import your existing company data such as vendors, customers, and items from Excel or Quickbooks.|
|Set Up Sales Tax         |Gets you started with default Tax groups and assigning Tax area codes that you can assign to customers and vendors in order to automatically calculate sales tax in sales or purchase documents.|
|Set Up Email             |Gets you ready for sending email messages directly from, for example, sales orders or contacts in Project "Madeira".|
|Set Up Office Add-Ins    |Sets up the ability to use and launch Project "Madeira" from Outlook 365.|
|Set Up Email Logging     |Sets up the capability to log email correspondance in Project "Madeira" to follow up on interactions.|
  
When you have run an assisted setup, it is marked as **Completed**. To run the assisted setup, you choose the three dots also called the context menu, and then you select **Start Setup**.

Project "Madeira" is related to the Dynamics NAV business management solution. As a result, some of the functionality that you can access in Project "Madeira" is limited in range, and occasionally you will be referred to Help for Dynamics NAV for more in-depth assistance. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/FwLink/?LinkId=31636">Microsoft Dynamics NAV</a> in the MSDN Library.
