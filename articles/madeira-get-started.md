# Welcome to Project "Madeira" 

Project "Madeira" is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Signing up is easy, and you can migrate existing business data from your legacy system.
When you have signed up for the Project "Madeira" preview, you have access to a trial version for a limited period. The trial version contains sample data, but you can create your own sales documents, for example, or set up a bank account.  

In the trial version, you can see visual guides that explain core functionality.  

Project "Madeira" is related to the Dynamics NAV business management solution. As a result, some of the functionality that you can access in Project "Madeira" is limited in range, and occasionally you will be referred to Help for Dynamics NAV for more in-depth assistance. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/FwLink/?LinkId=31636">Microsoft Dynamics NAV</a> in the MSDN Library.
