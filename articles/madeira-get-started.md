# Welcome to Project "Madeira"

Project "Madeira" is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Signing up is easy, and you can migrate existing business data from your legacy system.
When you have signed up for the Project "Madeira" preview, you have access to a demonstration company. The demonstration company contains sample data, but you can create your own sales documents, for example, or set up a bank account.  

In the preview, you can see visual guides that explain core functionality. These guides let you try out daily tasks such as making a sales invoice and viewing a report. When you want to explore Project "Madeira" on your own, you can always go back to the Getting Started tour by launching it from the Home page.   

## Trying things out in your own company
You can easily change from the demonstration company to work in your own company. Go to the **My Settings** menu in the top right corner, and change the company to **My Company**. Sign out of Project "Madeira" and then sign in again to have the change take effect. An assisted setup will now automatically guide you through setting up some of the basic information in your company. When that's done, explore the Home page and find the **Assisted Setup & Tasks** action as described in the next section.

## The Home page
The Home page is where you will find the **Assisted Setup & Tasks** action. Here you see a list of assisted setup that can help you getting started. Once you have migrated data such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system using the **Migrate Business Data** assisted setup you are ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if the other assisted setup can help you.

In the **Assisted Setup** window, you will find the following:

|Assisted Setup           |Description                                                                                      |

|Set Up Sales Tax         |Gets you started with default Tax groups and assigning Tax area codes that you can assign to customers and vendors in order to automatically calculate sales tax in sales or purchase documents.|
|Set Up Email             |Gets you ready for sending email messages directly from, for example, sales orders or contacts in Project "Madeira".|
|Set Up Office Add-Ins    |Sets up the ability to use and launch Project "Madeira" from Outlook.|
|Set Up Approval Workflow|Sets up the ability to automatically notify an approver when a user tries to create or change certain values on documents, journal lines, or cards, such as an amount above a specified limit.|
|Set Up Reporting Data    |Sets up data sets that you can use to build powerful reports using Excel or Power BI, for example.|
|Set Up Email Logging     |Sets up the capability to log email correspondence in Project "Madeira" to follow up on interactions.|
|Set Up Dynamics CRM Connection|Sets up a connection to Dynamics CRM which allows you to synchronize data such as contacts and sales order information.|

When you have run an assisted setup, it is marked as **Completed**. To run the assisted setup, you choose the three dots also called the context menu, and then you select **Start Setup**.  

Depending on the experience that you have specified in your company settings, some or all of the assisted setups will appear. 

<!-- Project "Madeira" is related to the Dynamics NAV business management solution. As a result, some of the functionality that you can access in Project "Madeira" is limited in range, and occasionally you will be referred to Help for Dynamics NAV for more in-depth assistance.
