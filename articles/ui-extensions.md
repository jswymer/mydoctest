# Customizing Project "Madeira" Using Extensions
You can change Project "Madeira" by installing extensions that add functionality, changes behavior, or gives you access to new online services, for example. 
When you first launch Project "Madeira", some extensions are already installed for you. Over time, more extensions will be made available to you, and you can then choose if you want to use the extension or not.

For example, Microsoft provides an extension that provides integration with PayPal Payments Standard. This extension is installed by default. 
But if another extension is made available that offers integration with another payment service, you can install the new extension and then choose which of the two services to use.  

## Installing an Extension
In the **Extension Management** window, you can see the extensions that have been made available to you, and you can see if they are installed or not. If you choose an extension, you can read about what the extension does, and you can access Help for the extension to learn more.
If you uninstall an extension, and you then change your mind, you can install it again. When you uninstall an extension that you have been using, the data is preserved so that if you install the extension again, your data is still available.  

When you install an extension, you might have to set it up, such as specifying an account for use with the **PayPal Payments Standard for Project "Madeira"** extension. 
Other extensions simply add fields to an existing page, or they add a new page, for example.
