# Specify Printer Selection for Reports
This page is empty because you cannot yet set up specific printers for specific reports. We are working on solving this. 

In the meantime, when you want to print a report you have to download the report as a PDF document first by choosing the **Send to** button. Then you select the type of file to download the report as, and here you should pick **PDF Document**. Now, you can either open the PDF document right-away and print it, or save it and print it later.

<!--

You can set up reports so that they must be printed on a specific printer. The following are some uses of printer selection:

- You can print reports on special company letterhead.
- You can print reports on different paper sizes.
- You can print reports on the default printer of a specified employee.

You use the **Printer Selections** window to set different values to obtain different output. If you set a specific printer selection, then it takes precedence over a more general printer selection. For example, you can set a printer selection that has values in the **User ID**, **Report ID**, and **Printer Name** fields. This printer selection takes precedence over a printer selection that has blank entries in the **User ID** or **Report ID** fields.

The following table describes the combination of values to specify when you set up printer selections for a report.

|To                                                 |Set the following values                                             |
