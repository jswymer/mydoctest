# Project “Madeira” Extensions by Other Providers
In Project "Madeira", the **Extension Management** window lists all available extensions. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. We refer to the websites that these companies provide for more information about the extensions that are not published by Microsoft. However, this page gives you a brief overview of the extensions by other publishers.
