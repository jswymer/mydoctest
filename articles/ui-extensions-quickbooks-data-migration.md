# The QuickBooks Data Migration Extension to Project "Madeira"
This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, and items from QuickBooks to Project “Madeira”. If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information to an .IFF file. You can then open an assisted setup guide to transfer the data.  
  
For more information, see [Import Data from Other Finance Systems](upload-data.md).
