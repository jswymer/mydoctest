# The QuickBooks Data Migration Extension for Project "Madeira"
This extension makes it easy to migrate customers, vendors, items, and accounts from QuickBooks to Project “Madeira”. If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information and then open an assisted setup guide to upload the data to Project "Madeira".  
For more information, see [Migrate Business Data from Other Finance Systems](upload-data.md).

## Exporting Data from QuickBooks
You must have exported some or all of your existing customers, vendors, inventory items, and accounts to an Intuit Interchange Format (IIF) file. The QuickBooks Data Migration extension includes a default mapping of QuickBooks data so that you can use your existing data to test your new Project "Madeira" company. The default mapping will be sufficient in the vast majority of cases, but you can change the mapping in the assisted setup guide.  
In QuickBooks, the File menu includes a utility to export lists. For the purposes of Project "Madeira", you can export the following lists:
- Customer List
- Vendor List
- Item List
- Account List  

The exported data is saved as an IIF file that you can then upload to Project "Madeira.
