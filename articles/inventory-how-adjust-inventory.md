# How to: Adjust Inventory   
After you have made a physical count of an item in your inventory area, you can use the **Adjust Inventory** function to record the actual inventory quantity.

You can also use the function as a simple way to place purchased items on inventory if you do not use the **Purchase Invoice** window to record your purchases. For more information, [How to: Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md)

## To adjust an item's quantity on inventory
1. On the Home page, choose the **Items** action to open the list of existing items.
2. Select the item for which you want to adjust inventory, and then choose the **Adjust Inventory** action.
3. In the **New Inventory** field, enter the inventory quantity that you want to record for the item.
4. Choose the **OK** button.

The item’s inventory is now adjusted. The new quantity is shown in the **Current Inventory** field in the **Adjust Inventory** window and in the **Inventory** field in the **Item Card** window.
