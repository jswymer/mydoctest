# Currencies
You must set up a code for each currency you use if you buy or sell in currencies other than your local currency, have receivables or payables in other currencies, or record G/L transactions in different currencies.  

## Set up a Currency Exchange Rate Service
You can use an external service to get the latest currency exchange rates into the **Currencies** window. To update currency exchange rates, you must first set up the service. 
The service that provides updated currency exchange rates is enabled by a data exchange definition in the **Currency Exchange Rate Service** window.  

**Note**: You can only set up a currency exchange rate service if your Financials plan includes the Suite experience.
