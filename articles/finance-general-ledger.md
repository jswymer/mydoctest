# The General Ledger and the Chart of Accounts
The general ledger stores your financial data, and the chart of accounts shows the accounts that all general ledger entries are posted to. Project "Madeira" includes a standard chart of accounts that is ready to support your business. 

## General Ledger Setup and General Posting Setup
At the core of your business processes is the general ledger and the configuration of how data is posted to the general ledger. 
In the **General Ledger Setup** window, you specify how you to handle certain accounting issues in your company. This includes invoice rounding details, address formats, and whether you want to use an additional reporting currency, for example. 
Similarly, in the **General Posting Setup** window, you specify how you want to set up combinations of general business and general product posting groups. You fill in a line for each combination of business posting group and product posting group.  

## The Chart of Accounts
The chart of accounts shows all accounts, and from here, you can open various reports that show your general ledger entries and balances, and you can close the income statement. 

For each account, you can open the G/L account card and add or change settings. You can also see a list of posting groups that post to that account.  

Project "Madeira" will prevent you from deleting a general ledger account that stores data that is needed in the chart of accounts.
