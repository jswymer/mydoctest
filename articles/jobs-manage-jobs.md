# Manage Time Sheets and Projects
In Dynamics 365 for Financials, you can manage common project management tasks, such as configuring a job and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual jobs, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.
