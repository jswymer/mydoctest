# Manage Time Sheets and Jobs for Projects
In Dynamics 365 for Financials, you can manage common project management tasks, such as configuring a job and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual jobs, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.

Before you can use Financials to manage projects, you must set up time sheets and jobs. For more information, see [Set Up Time Sheets and Jobs for Projects](jobs-setup-jobs.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.

|Plan for resources to be used in job and compare actual item and resource usage to budgeted usage to improve the quality and cost efficiency of future jobs.|[How to: Manage Job Budgets](jobs-how-manage-budgets.md)|
|Post the consumption of materials, resources, and other expenses of job work in process (WIP) to monitor its financial value and to maintain correct financial statements even though you post job expenses before invoicing the job.|[How to: Monitor Job Progress and Performance](jobs-how-monitor-progress-performance.md)|
