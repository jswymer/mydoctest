# Set Up Time Sheets and Jobs for Projects
Before you can use Financials to manage projects, you must set up time sheets and jobs.

Then you can create jobs and schedule resources for projects as well as manage budgets and track machine and employee hours with time sheets. For more information, see [Manage Time Sheets and Jobs for Projects](jobs-manage-jobs.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
