# How to: Register Employees
To use the Human Resources functionality, you must register employees by creating an employee card for each with all the core and related information.

You can modify an employee's details at any time. Keeping up-to-date records about your employees simplifies personnel tasks. For example, if an employee's address changes, you register this on the employee card.

## To set up an employee
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.
3. Close the window.

## To register an alternative address for an employee
You can use alternate addresses to keep track of your employeesâ€™ location, for example if they are stationed abroad, on a long business trip, or residing at a summer residence.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant employee, and then choose the **Alternate Addresses** action.
3. **In the Alternate Address List** window, fill in the fields as necessary.
4. Repeat step 3 for each alternate address.
5. Close the window.

## To insert a picture of an employee
If you have a digitalized picture of an employee, that is, a picture that is a file in .bmp format, you can insert it on the employee card.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Employees**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant employee,  and then choose the **Picture** action.
3. In the **Empolyee Picture** window, choose the **Insert Picture** action.
4. Select the file, and then choose **Open**.
5. Close the window.
