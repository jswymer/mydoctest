# Using Project “Madeira” without Outlook
Project “Madeira” has deep integration with Office 365, and you can use Project "Madeira" as your business inbox in Outlook. But if you do not have Outlook, you can work with Project "Madeira" in the browser or on your mobile device.  

## Sending Email
You can send documents such as invoices as email using your business email address. From your Home page, you can access an assisted setup guide that helps you set up email. If you do not use an Office 365 email account, you must specify technical information about your mail server. If you do not have this information available, please contact your IT support staff.
