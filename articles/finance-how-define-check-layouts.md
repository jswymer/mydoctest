#How to: Define Check Layouts

You can design your checks to conform with the standards set by the local authorities. Check images can be printed in English, French, or Spanish.

Checks are designed to print in both the United States and Canadian check image formats in either a check-stub-check format or a stub-stub-check format. 

##To define check layouts
1. In the **Search** box, enter **Report Selections Bank Account**, and choose the related link.
2. In the **Report Selection - Bank Acc.** window, in the **Usage** field, select **Check**.
3. Select one of the following report IDs.

| Report ID   | Report Name   | Description |
|------|-------------------|
|1401|Check|This is the default report.|
|10401|Check (Stub/Stub/Check)|This report is designed to print checks in a stub/stub/check format.|
|10411|Check (Stub/Check/Stub)|This report is designed to print checks in a check/stub/check format.|

When you have set up check layouts, you can print checks from the **Payment Journal** window. For more information, see [Work With Checks](payables-how-work-checks.md).
