# Analyze cash flow in your company 
As they say, cash is king. The charts on the Accountant Role Center provide insight that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash.  

|To answer questions like these | Use this chart|
|--- | ----|
|How long does the sales process tie up my cash?</br> Should I increase or reduce inventory levels? | Cash Cycle|
|When did cash move in and out of my company?</br> Are some periods better than others? | Cash Flow|
|Do the numbers seem off for a period?</br> Should I investigate? | Income & Expense|
|When might a cash surplus or deficit happen?</br> Should I pay down debt, or borrow to meet upcoming expenses? | Cash Flow Forecasts|
  
## Dig into the numbers
On the Accountant Role Center, under **Finance Performance**, the **Cash Cycle**, **Cash Flow**, and **Income & Expense** charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:  
  
- See figures for a period by using the timeline slider.  
- Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.  
- Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the **Finance Performance** drop down.  
- View the entries by choosing a point in the chart. For example, a point on the timeline or a column segment. If the numbers seem off, this is where you can make adjustments.  
  
Although it's separate, the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart is similar. You view details, filter results, and change what's displayed in the same ways. If you change a setting, you can refresh the forecast by choosing **Cash Flow Forecast**, and then **Recalculate Forecast**.
  
If you want to examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:
    
- Handles confirmed sales and purchases.  
- Subtracts payables and adds receivables.  
- Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.  
  
To view a cash flow worksheet:  
  
1. Search for **Cash Flow Forecasts**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Choose a cash flow forecast, and then choose the **Cash Flow Worksheet** action.  
3. On the **Cash Flow Worksheet** page, choose the **Suggest Worksheet Lines** action.
