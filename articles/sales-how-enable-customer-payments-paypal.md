#How to: Enable Customer Payments Through PayPal#
As an alternative to collecting payments through bank transfer, checks, and other payment methods, you can offer your customers to pay you through their PayPal account.

When a customer chooses the PayPal hyperlink on a sales invoice or sales order document, the service page for their PayPal account appears showing the payment details for the sale. The customer can then pay the invoice as any other PayPal payment.

To enable customer payments through PayPal, you must do the following:
1. Set up PayPal Standard as a payment service in the **Payments Services** window.
2. Select PayPal Standard in the **Payment Service** field on the sales document in question.

##To enable the PayPal payment service
1. In the **Search** box, **Payment Services**, and then choose the related link.  
2. In the **Payment Services** window, choose the **New** action.
3. Select **PayPal Standard**, and then choose the **OK** button.
4. In the **Payment Services** window, choose the **Setup** action.
5. Fill the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.

  **Note**: Select the **Always Include on Documents** check box if the hyperlink for the PayPal payment service should always be visible on sales documents where payment through PayPal is enabled.
6. Choose the **OK** button.

##To select PayPal standard on a customer card
1. In the **Search** box, **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the card of the customer that you want to enable PayPal payments for.
3. In the **Payment Service** field, choose PayPal Standard**.
