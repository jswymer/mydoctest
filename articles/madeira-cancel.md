# Canceling Project "Madeira"
When you have signed up for Project "Madeira", you can choose to cancel your subscription at any time. Similarly, you can choose to reset the company that you can been using in Project "Madeira". This page describes how to cancel your Project "Madeira" experience.  

## Removing Project "Madeira" from your Office 365 experience
If you have signed up for Project "Madeira" using an existing Office 365 business account, you must ask your Office 365 administrator to remove Project "Madeira" license from your user account.  
User accounts and licenses are managed in the [Office Portal](https://portal.office.com). Only administrators can remove Project "Madeira" licenses from user accounts. If other people from your company has signed up to Project "Madeira", they will still have access to your shared data in the Project "Madeira" company.  
 
## Unsubscribing from Project "Madeira"   
If you signed up for Project "Madeira" using a non-Office 365 business account, you do not have an Office 365 administrator. Instead, you must unsubscribe by contacting the Project "Maderia" Cancelation team. Currently, you must contact the team by sending an email message at cancel-madeira@microsoft.com. You must include the name of your Project "Madeira" tenant in the message so that we can identify you. The easiest way to do that is to copy the URL from your Project "Madeira" Home page.  

## Resetting your Project "Madeira" experience
If you have added data to your Project "Madeira" preview and you want to start over with a fresh experience, you can create a new company and then resetting the first company. If you open the **Companies** page, you can create a copy of your current company, sing out and then sign into your new company, and then reset the original company.  
**Note**: When you reset a company that you are sharing with other people from your organization, you must make sure other people are not logged in when you reset the company.
