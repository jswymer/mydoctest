# How to: Import Payroll Transactions 
To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import financial transactions made by your payroll provider into the general ledger. To do this, you import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** window and then post the transactions in question.

## To import a payroll file
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **General Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the relevant general journal batch, choose the **Import Payroll Transactions** action.
3. In the **Import** window, select the relevant payroll file, and then choose the **OK** button.

    The general journal is filled with lines representing the financial transactions that the payroll file contains.
4. Edit or post the journal lines as for any other general ledger transactions. For more information, see [How to: Work With General Journals](ui-work-general-journals.md).
