# Using Search for Page or Report
You can find any page, report, or view by choosing the **Search for Page or Report** icon in the top right corner of the address bar. The button looks like this:

![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/searchpageorreport.png "Search for Page or Report")

When you start typing characters, a drop-down list shows page names containing the character(s) you type. The drop-down list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct page from the list when it is displayed. The second column in the drop-down list shows the navigation paths to the found pages.

**Note**: The **Search for Page or Report** does not search through data, such as customer names, addresses, or transactions. Instead, you can search for data in list pages by choosing the magnifier symbol in the right corner of the list header. The search applies only to the list you are viewing. For information on using this type of search, see [Entering Criteria in Filters](ui-enter-criteria-filters.md).
