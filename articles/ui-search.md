# Using Search for Page or Report
You can find any page, report, or view by using the **Search for Page or Report** field in the top right corner of the address bar.

When you start typing characters, a drop-down list shows page names containing the character(s) you type. The drop-down list changes as you type more characters, and you can select the correct page from the list when it is displayed. The second column in the drop-down list shows the navigation paths to the found pages.
