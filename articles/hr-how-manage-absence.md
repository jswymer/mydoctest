# How to: Manage Employee Absence
To manage an employee's absence, you must record the absence in the **Absence Registration** window. It can then be viewed in different ways for analysis and reporting needs.

You can view employee absence in two different windows:

- The **Absence Registration** window, where you register all employee absences with a line for each absence.
- The **Employee Absences** window, where the absences for one employee only is shown. This is the information that you entered in the **Absence Registration** window, filtered by the particular employee.

You can register employee absences on a daily basis or however suits your administrator. To obtain meaningful statistics, you should always use the same unit of measure (hour or day) when registering employee absences.

## To register employee absence
You can register employee absences on a daily basis or at some other interval that meets your organizational needs.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Absence Registration**, and then choose the related link.
2. Create a new absence registration. On the Home tab, in the New group, choose New.
3. Fill in a line for each employee absence you want to register, and then close the window.
