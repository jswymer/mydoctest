# How to: Manage Employee Absence
To manage an employee's absence, you must record the absence in the **Absence Registration** window. It can then be viewed in different ways for analysis and reporting needs.

You can view employee absence in two different windows:

- The **Absence Registration** window, where you register all employee absences with a line for each absence.
- The **Employee Absences** window, where the absences for one employee only is shown. This is the information that you entered in the **Absence Registration** window, filtered by the particular employee.

To obtain meaningful statistics, you should always use the same unit of measure (hour or day) when registering employee absences.
