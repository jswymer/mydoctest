# How to: Work with Non-Stock Items
You can offer certain items to your customers for their convenience, which you do not want to keep in inventory, for example, for cost reasons. When you want to start maintaining inventory for such nonstock items, for example, because the sale has increased, you can convert them to normal item cards. For more information, see [How to: Register New Products](inventory-how-register-new-products.md).

A nonstock item typically has the item number of the vendor who supplies it. To enable conversion of a nonstock item card to a normal item card, you must first set up how this number format is converted to your own item number format.   

## To create a nonstock item card
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Nonstock Items**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.
