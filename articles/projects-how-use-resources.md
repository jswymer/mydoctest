# How to: Use Resources in Projects
When you record the usage of resources in the job journal, you can keep track of costs and prices, and the specific work types and jobs linked to them. To do so, you must select an existing job in the Job No. field.

You can also sell resources by using sales quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos. In the following example, a sales order is used.

You can post the usage of a resource in a resource journal or a job journal. Entries posted in a resource journal have no effect on the general ledger.
