# How to: Use Resources in Projects
When you record the usage of resources in the job journal, you can keep track of costs and prices, and the specific work types and jobs linked to them. To do so, you must select an existing job in the Job No. field.

You can also sell resources by using sales quotes, orders, invoices, and credit memos. In the following example, a sales order is used.

You can post the usage of a resource in a resource journal or a job journal. Entries posted in a resource journal have no effect on the general ledger.

## To adjust resource prices  
If you want to change costs or prices for a large number of resources, you can use a batch job.  
    
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Adjust Resource Costs/Prices**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Fill in the fields on a line as necessary, and then choose the **OK** button. 
  
**Note**: This batch job does not create or adjust alternate costs or prices for resources. It only changes the contents of the field on the resource card for the **Adjust Field** field that you selected in the batch job. The adjustment will take effect immediately for resources, so check your adjustment factors before you run the batch job.
