# How to: Set up Email
To send and receive emails from within Financials, you must fill in the fields in the **SMTP Mail Setup** window.

**Note**: Instead of entering the SMTP server details, you can use a function to enter them with information from your Office 365 subscription.

You can either set email up manually or you can get help by using the **Email Setup** assisted setup. For more information, see [Getting Ready for Doing Business](ui-get-ready-business.md).  

## To set up email
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **SMTP Email Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill in the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.
3. Alternatively, choose the **Apply Office 365 Server Settings** action to insert any information that is already defined for your Office 365 subscription.
4. When all the fields are correctly filled in, choose the **Test Email Setup** action.
5. When the test succeeds, close the window.
