# Using Project “Madeira” as your Business Inbox in Outlook
Project “Madeira” introduces the ability to manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in Microsoft Outlook. With the Project “Madeira” Outlook Add-in, you can see financial data related to customers and vendors, as well as create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.  

Some companies using Office 365 restrict users’ permissions to deploy add-ins. So you must make sure that you have an Office 365 subscription that includes email and allows yyou to deploy add-ins. You can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Office 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).  

## Get the add-in
In Project “Madeira,” one of the steps in the Getting Started assisted setup is the **Run your business from within Office 365** page. On that page, when you choose the **Set up in Outlook** button, you must specify your Office 365 user name and password. The Project "Madeira" add-in is then automatically added to your Outlook.  

Then, when you open Outlook, you should see three email messages from Project “Madeira” Admin, Andy Teal, and Julia Collins, respectively. The new add-in is added to the Outlook ribbon, and in Outlook Web Access, you can see it in the add-in ribbon, immediately above the body of the email message.
