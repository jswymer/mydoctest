# Using Project “Madeira” as your Business Inbox in Outlook
Project “Madeira” introduces the ability to manage business interactions with your customers and vendors, directly in Microsoft Outlook. With the Project “Madeira” Outlook Add-in, you can see financial data related to customers and vendors, as well as create and send financial documents, such as quotes and invoices.  

Some companies using Office 365 restrict users’ permissions to deploy add-ins. So you must make sure that you have an Office 365 subscription that includes email and allows you to deploy add-ins. You can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Office 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).  

## Get the add-in
In Project “Madeira”, one of the steps in the Getting Started assisted setup is the **Run your business within Office 365** window. In that window, when you choose the **Set up in Outlook** button, you must specify your Office 365 user name and password. The Project "Madeira" add-in is then automatically added to your Outlook.  

Then, when you open Outlook, you should see three email messages from Project “Madeira” Admin, Wide World Importers, and Jim Glynn, respectively. The new add-in is added to the Outlook ribbon, and in Outlook Web Access, you can see it in the add-in ribbon, immediately above the body of the email message.  

## Using the add-in
If you open the *Project “Madeira” Evaluation Email #1* message from Jim Glynn, you can see that they want to get a quote on some items. Directly in Outlook, you can open the Project “Madeira” add-in, which recognizes Jim as a customer, and opens the customer card for his company, Coho Winery. From this dashboard, you can see overview information for the customer, as well as drill down for more detail on specific documents. You can also dig into the sales history for the customer.
In the add-in, you can create a sales quote and send it back to this customer without leaving Outlook. All of the information that you need to send the sales quote is available in your business inbox in Outlook.  
Once you have the data entered, you can post the quote. You can then send it by email. Project "Madeira" generates a .PDF file with the sales quote and attaches it to the email message that you draft in the add-in.  

If you open the *Project “Madeira” Evaluation Email #2* message from Wide World Importers, you can see how you can work with vendors and purchase invoices.  

Sometimes you want to see more fields that you can see in the add-in, such as when you want to fill in lines in an invoice. To give you a bit more space to work with, you can pop out the add-in to a separate window. It's still part of Outlook, but you have more space. As you enter data for the document in the pop-out view, the changes are automatically saved. When you are done entering data for the document, you can close the window. Choosing the add-in frame in Outlook automatically refreshes the document with the changes you made in the pop-out view.  

## Quick document lookup
The Project “Madeira” Document Links add-in gives you quick access to documents mentioned in email messages. The add-in is available for an email message if a document number is recognized in the body of the message. Opening the add-in provides quick access to the document.  
  
For example, if you receive an email message that mentions the text *S-QUO100*, Project "Madeira" identifies that as a sales quote, and so you can open this document in Outlook. In Outlook, choose the **Document Links** button immediately above the body of the email message. In the Outlook Web App, choose the *S-QUO1001* text in the body of the email message.  

In the Document Links add-in, you can modify and take actions with the document, just like you can in Project “Madeira”.

## Create invoices from your meeting appointments
Some businesses record all billable appointments in the Outlook calendar. With Project "Madeira", you can create the invoice for the customer right from the calendar item: Open the appointment, and then you can open the Project "Madeira" add-in, look up existing information or create an invoice or another sales document right there.
