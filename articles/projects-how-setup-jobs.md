# How to: Set Up Jobs
When you start a new project, a job must be created. Job planning has two layers:

The first layer consists of job task lines. It is necessary to set up at least one job task because all posting needs to refer to a job task. Having at least one job task in your project enables you to set up planning lines and to post consumption to the job.

The second layer consists of planning lines, which specify the detailed use of resources, items and various general ledger expenses.

All jobs that you create can be separated into task lines and planning lines. This enables you to divide the job into smaller tasks, and therefore use more specific details in budgeting, quotes and registration.
