# How to: Set Up Alternative Addresses for Contacts
You can assign an alternative address where your contacts are sometimes sent mail and information, for example, their summer cottage. You can also assign one or several date ranges to each alternative address you have entered for your contacts to specify when each address is valid.

## To assign an alternative address
1. Open the contact.
2. Choose the **Alternative Address** action, and then choose **Card**. The **Contact Alt. Address List** window opens.
3. Enter a new alternative address and fill in the fields on the **Contact Alternative Address** window.

Repeat these steps to assign as many alternative addresses as you want. For each alternative address you may want to specify one or several date ranges.

You can also assign alternative addresses from the contact list window by following the same procedure.

## To assign an alternative address date range
1. Open the contact.
2. Choose the **Alternative Address** action, and then choose **Date Range**. The **Contact Alt. Addr. Date Ranges** window opens.
3. Choose **New** action.
4. In the **Contact Alt. Address Code** field, select an alternative address for this contact, and then fill in the **Starting Date** and **Ending Date** fields.

Repeat these steps to assign as many date ranges as you want.
