# Customizing the Dynamics 365 for Financials Experience
Financials is designed to help you run your business, regardless which line of business you are in. At the core of Financials, you find financial reporting and sales and purchasing processes. You add experiences to that according to your business needs by adding [extensions from AppSource](ui-extensions.md). But you can also turn up and down the volume on the user experience and choose what's right for your company.

## Choosing a User Experience
In the **Company Information** window, you can choose a user experience for your company. The user experience determines how much of the core functionality is available in the windows that you and your colleagues work in. For example, this can help you focus on core tasks.
  
     **Note**: This setting applies to all users in your company.  
The following table lists the experience that are available in the current update of Financials.

| Experience                    | Impact on user interface |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
|Basic |Show only core actions and fields for core business areas, such as sales, purchasing, finance, and opportunity management.|
|Suite |Show more actions and fields for core business areas and for other areas, such as project management, fixed asset management, and analysis by dimensions.|
