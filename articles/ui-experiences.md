# Customizing the Dynamics 365 for Financials Experience
Financials is designed to help you run your business, regardless which line of business you are in. At the core of Financials, you find financial reporting and sales and purchasing processes. You add experiences to that according to your business needs by adding [extensions from AppSource](ui-extensions.md). But you can also tune up and down the user experience by choosing the right experience for your company.

In the **Company Information** window, you can set the user experience for your company. The user experience determines how much of the core functionality is visible in the windows that you and your colleagues work in. For example, in the current update of Financials, the following experiences are available:

| Experience                    | Impact on user interface |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
|Basic |Show only core actions and fields for core business areas, such as sales, purchasing, finance, and opportunity management.|
|Suite |Show more actions and fields for core business areas and for other areas, such as project management, fixed asset management, and analysis by dimensions.|

**Note**: This setting applies to all users in your company.

## To choose another experience
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Company Information**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Experience** field, select the relevant experience.
3. Close the window.
4. Sign out and back into Financials for the changes to take effect.
