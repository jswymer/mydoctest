# Customizing Your Project "Madeira" Experience
Project "Madeira" is designed to help you run your business, regardless which line of business you are in. At the core of Project "Madeira", you find financial reporting and sales and purchasing processes. You add experiences to that according to your business needs by adding [extensions from AppSource](ui-extensions.md). But you can also tune up and down the user experience by choosing the right experience for your company.

## Choosing the Experience
In the **Company Settings** window, you can set the user experience for your company. The user experience determines how much of the core functionality is visible in the windows that you and your colleagues work in. For example, in the current update of Project "Madeira", the following experiences are available:

| Experience                    | Impact on user interface |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
|Basic | Show only core actions and fields for sales, purchasing, and financials.|
|Basic with relationship management| Show only core actions and fields for sales, purchasing, financials, and relationship management.|
|Suite |Show more actions and fields, including dimensions and currency exchange rates.|

**Note**: This setting applies to all users in your company.
