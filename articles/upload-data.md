# Migrate Business Data from Other Finance Systems
When you sign up for Financials, you can choose to create an empty company so that you can upload your own data and to test your new Financials company. Depending on the finance solution that your business uses today, you can transfer information about customers, vendors, inventory, and bank accounts.  

From Home, you can start an assisted setup guide that helps you transfer the business data from an Excel file or from other formats. The type of files you can upload depends on the extensions that are available. For example, you can migrate data from QuickBooks because Financials includes an extension that handles the conversion from QuickBooks. If you want to migrate data from other finance solutions, you must either check if an extension is available for that solution or import from Excel.  

Financials includes templates for accounts, customers, vendors, and inventory items that you can choose to apply when you import your data.  

## Migrate Data from QuickBooks or Dynamics GP
If your business uses QuickBooks or Dynamics GP today, you can export the relevant information to a file. You can then open the assisted setup guide to transfer the data.
For example, if your file includes customers and vendors, you can choose to transfer only the customer data. You can then transfer the rest of the information later.  

The assisted setup includes an option to change the default configuration of the transfer, but we recommend that you only enter this advanced setup if you are familiar with database tables. In the vast majority of businesses, the default mapping from QuickBooks or Dynamics GP to Financials will transfer the information that you want.
