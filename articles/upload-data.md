# Import Data from Other Finance Systems #
You can import your existing business data into Project "Madeira". Depending on the financial software solution that your business uses today, you can transfer information about customers, vendors, inventory, and bank accounts, for example.
From Home, you can start an assisted setup guide that helps you transfer the business data. For example, you can transfer data from QuickBooks or from an Excel file.  

##Transfer from QuickBooks
If your business uses QuickBooks today, you can export the relevant information to an .IFF file. You can then open the assisted setup guide to transfer the data. 
For example, if your .IFF file includes customers, vendors, and bank accounts, you can choose to transfer only the customer data. You can then transfer the rest of the information later.  
The assisted setup includes an option to change the default configuration of the transfer, but we recommend that you only enter this advanced setup if you are familiar with database tables. In the vast majority of businesses, the default mapping from QuickBooks to Project "Madeira" will transfer the information that you want.
