# Process Incoming Documents

To record an external document in Project "Madeira", you must first create or complete an incoming document record. You can do this manually, or you can take a photo of the external document and then create the incoming document record with the image file attached.

From PDF or image files that you receive from your trading partners, you can have an external OCR service (Optical Character Recognition) generate electronic documents that can be converted to document records in Project "Madeira". For example, when you receive an invoice in PDF format from your vendor, you can send it to the OCR service from the **Incoming Documents** window. Alternatively, you can send the file to the OCR service by email. Then, when you receive the electronic document back, a related incoming document record is created automatically. After some seconds, you receive the file back from the OCR service as an electronic invoice that can be converted to a purchase invoice for the vendor.

|Use an OCR service to turn PDF and image files into electronic documents that can be converted to purchase invoices in Project "Madeira", for example. Train the OCR service to avoid errors next time it processes similar data.|[How to: Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Documents](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md)|
|Connect or remove incoming document records for any non-posted sales or purchase document and to any customer, vendor, or general ledger entry from the document or entry.|[How to: Connect and Disconnect Incoming Document Records from Documents and Entries](across-how-connect-disconnect-income-document-records.md)|
|From the **Chart of Accounts** and **General Ledger Entries** windows, use a search function to find general ledger entries for posted documents that do not have incoming document records and then centrally link to existing records or create new ones with attached document files.|[How to: Find Posted Documents without Incoming Document Records](across-how-find-posted-documents-without-income-document-records.md)|
