# Analyze cash flow in your company 
As they say, cash is king. This topic describes how to use the charts on the Accountant Role Center to get insight into your cash flow.  

The charts provide answers that can help you make solid decisions about what to do with your cash.

To answer questions like these | Use this chart
--- | ----
How long does the sales process tie up my cash?</br> Should I increase or reduce inventory levels? | Cash Cycle
When did cash move in and out of my company?</br> Are some periods better than others? | Cash Flow
Do the numbers seem off for a period?</br> Should I investigate? | Income & Expense
When might a cash surplus or deficit happen?</br> Should I pay down debt, or borrow to meet upcoming expenses? | Cash Flow Forecasts

## Dig in to the numbers
On the Accountant Role Center, under **Finance Performance**, the **Cash Cycle**, **Cash Flow**, and **Income & Expense** charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:
- See figures for a period by using the timeline slider.
- Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.
- Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the **Finance Performance** drop down.
- Choose a point in the chart, for example on the timeline or a column segment, to view the source of the data and the calculations. If the numbers seem odd, this is where you can make adjustments. 

Although it's separate, the **Cash Flow Forecast** chart is similar. You view details, filter results, and change what's displayed in the same ways. If you change a setting, you can refresh the forecast by choosing **Cash Flow Forecast**, and then **Recalculate Forecast**.

To take a look at the data behind the forecast, including the variance, choose the **Cortana Intelligence** column. The first row in the table displays the variance. The other rows are arranged by source document. For example, you can see how the forecast:    
- Handles confirmed sales and purchases 
- Subtracts payables and adds receivables
- Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders

    **Note:** Cash flow forecasts can use Cortana Intelligence and Azure Machine Learning to include documents with a due date in the future. The result is a more comprehensive prediction than the **Cash Flow** chart, which is based solely on historical data.
