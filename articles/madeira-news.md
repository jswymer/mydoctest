# What's New in Dynamics 365 for Financials
We hope you already got started with Financials. This is still a preview only, but we have added capabilities that we hope you find interesting.  
Sign up for the preview, let us walk you through the basics of what you can do with Financials, and then try things out on your own for a while. When you are ready, you can open a blank company and set things up for yourself. Optionally, you can import your own business data to the company.  

On a regular basis, we will update Financials with additional capabilities in the core application and with new [extensions](ui-extensions.md).

## September 2016 Update
The latest update of Financials adds new capabilities as [announced on the blog](https://madeira.microsoft.com/blog/2016-september-update).

### More flexibility in your sales processes
This update adds more flexibility in what you sell:
- You can now set up nonstock items - items that you offer to customers but do not maintain inventory for. For more information, see [How to: Work with Nonstock Items](inventory-how-work-nonstock-items.md).
- You can now mark an item for drop shipment on a sales order and immediately create a purchase order for the item. This way, you can sell an item to a customer, purchase it from the vendor, and have it shipped directly from your vendor to your customer. For more information, see [How to: Purchase Products for a Sale](purchasing-how-purchase-products-sale.md).

### Categorize items in your inventory
With this update, you can create a hierarchy of item categories and assign item attributes to each item category. For more information, see [How to: Categorize Items](inventory-how-categorize-items.md).

### Send purchase orders to vendors
Now you can enter purchase orders within Financials. For more information, see [How to: Record Purchases](purchasing-how-record-purchases.md).

### Better quality incoming documents
You can now easily correct errors in the scanned documents before you receive the resulting document - this way, you'll train the service to avoid the errors going forward. For more information, see [How to: Use OCR to Turn PDF and Image Files into Electronic Document](across-how-use-ocr-pdf-images-files.md).

## August 2016 Update
The latest update of Financials adds new capabilities as [announced on the blog](https://madeira.microsoft.com/blog/2016-august-update).

### Smart notifications give you advice and recommendations
With this update, you'll notice such notifications display when you create a sales invoice for a customer that has an overdue balance, or when the amount in the sales document exceeds the credit limit specified for the customer, for example. For more information, see [Smart Notifications](ui-smart-notifications.md).  

### Introducing the new Sales and Inventory Forecast extension
In this update, we introduce the new Sales and Inventory Forecast extension that gives you insights about potential sales and a clear overview of expected stock-outs. The extension uses [Cortana Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/what-is-cortana-intelligence-suite) to predict future sales based on your sales history to help you avoid inventory shortage. For more information, see [Sales and Inventory Forecast](ui-extensions-sales-forecast.md).  

###  Smarter sales and purchase documents
We've made several small but important improvements to sales and purchase documents:
- You can cancel posted credit memos
- Sales invoices include Package Tracking No. and Shipping Agent Code
- You can cross reference items
- You can substitute items

## July 2016 Update
The second update of Financials adds new capabilities as [announced on the blog](https://madeira.microsoft.com/blog/2016-july-update).  

### Working with incoming documents in Outlook
This update adds actions to the vendor dashboard in the Outlook add-in so you can work directly with attachments to the associated email. You use the actions to send the email attachments directly to the **Incoming Documents** list, send the documents to the OCR service, and send an approval request for the incoming document. For more information, see [Manage Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md).

### Create invoices in your Outlook calendar
The Outlook add-in now extends to the Outlook calendar. From a calendar appointment, you can open the Financials add-in and get an overview for the customer associated with the appointment. Then, you can create and send an invoice for the services provided in the meeting - all of this happening right there in the Outlook calendar. For more information, see [Using Financials as your Business Inbox in Outlook](madeira-outlook.md).  

### AppSource marketplace for extensions
Financials extensions are now available in the AppSource marketplace at [AppSource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). You will be able to search and find extensions in the marketplace. You will be able to view information, including marketing material, screenshots, videos and links to additional details. For more information, see [Customizing Dynamics 365 for Financials Using Extensions](ui-extensions.md).  

### Shipping agents and item attributes
You can add attributes to your inventory items that make it really easy to find the right product that your customer wants. For more information, see [How to: Work with Item Attributes](inventory-how-work-item-attributes.md).  

### New extensions made available
With this update, you can choose between even more extensions in the **Extension Management** window.
For more information, see [Financials Extensions by Other Providers](ui-extensions-other.md).  

### Manage your customer relationships using Microsoft Dynamics CRM from inside Financials
We've added a new assisted setup guide to the Business Manager home page that guides you through the setup process to connect to Dynamics CRM. Once that's done, you'll have a seamless coupling of Dynamics CRM records with Financials records. For more information, see [Manage your customer relationships using Microsoft Dynamics CRM from inside Financials ](marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.md).

## May 2016 Update
The first update of Financials adds new capabilities as [announced on the blog](https://madeira.microsoft.com/blog/2016-may-update).  

### New extensions made available
Check out the **Extension Management** window: The update adds new extensions, including Sana Commerce for Financials that provides B2B Commerce capabilities, and ChargeLogic Payments that provides payment and credit card processing capabilities. The extensions are not installed automatically for you, but the **Extension Management** window will help you install the extensions that you want to use. For more information, see [Financials Extensions by Other Providers](ui-extensions-other.md).  

### Filter on unprocessed incoming documents
We have also changed some core functionality in this month's update: The list of incoming documents is now filtered to show only entries that have not been used to create posted documents with. For more information, see [Manage Incoming Documents](across-income-documents.md).  

### Office Suite notifications are now enabled in Financials
In the top right corner, next to the Settings menu, you will notice the bell symbol that you probably already know well from other Office products: That's the Notifications menu. Here you will receive notifications such as new mail and calendar reminders directly while working in Financials.
