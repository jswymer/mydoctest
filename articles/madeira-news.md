# What's New in Project "Madeira" 
We hope you already got started with Project "Madeira". This is still a preview only, but we have added capabilities that we hope you find interesting.  
Sign up for the preview, let us walk you through the basics of what you can do with Project "Madeira", and then try things out on your own for a while. When you are ready, you can open a blank company and set things up for yourself. Optionally, you can import your own business data to the company.  
  
On a regular basis, we will update Project "Madeira" with additional capabilities in the core application and with new [extensions](ui-extensions.md). 
   
## May 2016 Update
