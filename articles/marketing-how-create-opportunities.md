# How to: Create Sales Opportunities
You can create opportunities for the sales opportunities you have on your contacts. All opportunities must be assigned to a salesperson or purchaser and must have a contact.

You can create opportunities from the **Opportunity List** window. But you typically will create opportunities from the specific contact or salespeople.

Before you can create opportunities, you must set up opportunity sales cycles. For more information see [How to: Set Up Opportunity Sales Cycles and Stages](marketing-how-setup-opportunity-sales-cycles-stages.md).

## To create an opportunity from a salesperson
1. In the **Search for Page or Report** field, enter **Salespeople**, and then choose the related link. 
2. Select the salesperson from the list for whom you want to create an opportunity.
3. Choose the **Opportunities** action, and then choose **List**.
4. Choose **New**, and then fill in the relevant fields.
