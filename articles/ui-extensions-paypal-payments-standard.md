# The PayPal Payments Standard Extension to Project "Madeira"
Customers continuously require higher customer service, both in terms of the quality of product but also in terms of delivery and payment services. PayPal Payments Standard adds a PayPal link to your sales documents so customers can easily pay using PayPal. Then, from inside Project “Madeira”, you can send the documents by email to provide higher customer service and shorten the time it takes for customers’ payments to arrive on your bank account.  
  
With this extension to Project “Madeira”, you can very simply embed a PayPal reference on an invoice. The PayPal Payments Standard extension provides the following benefits:  
- Customer payments appear faster on your bank account.
- Customers have more ways to pay invoices.
- PayPal offers a trustworthy payment service, which customers prefer entering credit card information on unknown web sites.
- PayPal offers multiple ways of handling payments including credit card processing, PayPal accounts, and other sources.
- PayPal does not require monthly fees or setup fees.
- PayPal link can be embedded automatically into every invoice document or by user.
- Because this functionality is built as an extension, it gives you full control to enable it when and if your business processes require it.
