# Manage Projects
In Dynamics 365 for Financials, you can perform common project management tasks, such as configuring a job and scheduling a resource, as well as providing the information needed to manage budgets and monitor progress. You can track machine and employee hours on the project by using time sheets. As a project manager, you have a good overview, not only of individual jobs, but also of the allocation of employees, machinery and other resources being used in all projects.

Before you can use Financials to manage projects, you must set up resources, time sheets, and jobs. For more information, see [Set Up Project Management](projects-setup-projects.md).  

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
