# Create a Contact from a Customer, Vendor, or Bank Account
If you have already set up a number of customers, vendors, and bank accounts, you can create contacts on the basis of the existing data. When you create a contact this way, the contact information is synchronized with the customer, vendor, or bank account information. 

Before you can create contact companies this way, you must specify a business relation code for customers, vendors, and bank accounts in the **Marketing Setup** window. If you will be creating contacts from a bank accounts, you must also specify numbers series for bank accounts in the **General Ledger Setup** window.


1. In the **Search** box, enter one of the following, depending on from where you want to create contacts, and then choose the related link.
  * **Create Contacts from Customers**
  * **Create Contacts from Vendors**
  * **Create Contacts from Bank Accounts**
  
  The batch job window opens.
2. In the **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Bank Account** section, set filters if you want to create contacts from specific customers, vendors, or bank accounts.
3. Choose the **OK** button to start creating contacts.

  The next contact numbers in the number series are assigned to the new contacts. The business relation for vendors that is specified in the **Marketing Setup** window is assigned to the newly created contacts.
