# How to: Set Up Purchasers
If several purchasers work at your company, you can set them up in a window and assign them each a code. You can then use the codes to prepare statistics and to filter information in printed reports.

## To set up purchasers
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Salespeople/Purchasers**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Salespeople/Purchasers** window, choose **New**.
3. In the **Salesperson/Purchaser Card** window, fill in the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.

## To assign purchasers to vendors
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant vendor card for the vendor that will be assigned a purchaser.
3. In the **Purchaser Code** field, select the applicable purchaser code and then close the window.
