# How to: Work with Item Attributes
When a customer inquiries about an item, either in correspondence or through a web shop, the customer may ask or search according to characteristics, such as size and color. To provide this customer service, you can assign item attribute values of different types to your items, which will then function as categories when searching or sorting items.

## To create an item attribute
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Item Attributes**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Item Attributes** window, choose the **New** action.
3. In the **Item Attribute** window, fill the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.

**Note**: If you select **Option** in the **Type** field, then you can choose the **Item Attribute Values** action to select or set up item attribute values. For more information, see the "To assign item attribute values to item attributes" section.  

## To assign item attribute values to an item attribute
1. In the **Item Attributes** window, select the item attribute that you want to assign values to, and then choose the **Item Attribute Values** action.
2. In the **Item Attribute Values** window, fill the fields as necessary. Choose a field to read a short description of the field or link to more information.

**Note**: You can also assign item attribute values from an item attribute card. For more information, see the note in the ""To create an item attribute"" section.
