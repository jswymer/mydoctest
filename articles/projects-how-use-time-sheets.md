# How to: Use Time Sheets
Use the Create Time Sheets batch job to set up time sheets for a specified number of time periods or weeks. You must have permissions to be able to create time sheets. After a time sheet is created,the time sheet owner can open it and record time that has been spent on a task.

You can copy and use your job planning lines in a time sheet. In that way, you only have to enter the information in one place and the line information is always correct.

After you have approved time sheet entries for a job, you can post them to the relevant job journal or resource journal.
