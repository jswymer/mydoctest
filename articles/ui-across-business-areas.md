# Across Business Areas

Project "Madeira" provides dedicated functionality for typical business areas, such as finance and sales. And to support your business area-specific tasks, you can use a variety of general business functionality, such as **Number Series** and **Extensions**, which is available across these areas.

The following table lists these general business areas with links to topics that describe them.
