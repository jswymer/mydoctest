# The QuickBooks Online Data Share Extension for Dynamics 365 for Financials
If your business uses QuickBooks Online, this extension lets you share customers and items with Financials, so that you can push invoices from Financials to QuickBooks Online.

<!-- Questions
why would you do this? 
how do you push an invoice from SaaS to QuickBooks Online?/-->

To connect the two services, use the **QuickBooks Online Data Sharing** assisted setup guide. The guide will help you authorize a company in QuickBooks Online to share data with Financials. You just need to know which company, and your login credentials for your QuickBooks Online account. Once connected, Financials will look for updates in the QuickBooks Online company every five minutes.

<!-- Do we need to say more about what data is shared? I've mentioned items and customers, but maybe we should be more specific and say something like, "only the data we need in order to share an invoice..." /-->

## To connect QuickBooks with Financials
1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Pages and Reports** icon, enter **QuickBooks Online Data Sharing**, and choose the related link.
2. Complete the steps in the assisted setup guide.
