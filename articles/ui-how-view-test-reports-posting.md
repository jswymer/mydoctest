# How to: View Test Reports Before Posting
When you are ready to post a document, such as an order, invoice, or a credit memo, you can test the document to ensure that no issues exist that will block the posting.

**Note**: The following procedure is about testing before posting a purchase document. The functionality works in the same way for sales documents.

## To print a test report before posting a purchase invoice
1. In the **Search for Page or Report** field, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the purchase invoice that you want to test.
3. Choose **Test Report**.  

All parts of the purchase invoice are tested, and the result is presented in a report. If the report indicates any errors or missing information, then you must correct the problem before posting the purchase invoice.
