# The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Extension to Project "Madeira"
To quickly reconcile payments made to your bank accounts, the Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds service allows you to link your system bank account to your online bank account. This means that the latest bank statement is automatically or manually fed into your reconciliation journal, ensuring that you are always processing the latest payments with minimal risk of errors. 
  
When you have enabled the bank feed service, you must link the involved bank account to the online bank account that the feed will come from. You link bank accounts to online bank accounts in the following different scenarios:

- A bank account does not exist in Project "Madeira" for your online bank account. Therefore, you create the bank account by linking from the online bank account.
- A bank account exists in Project "Madeira", which you want to link to an online bank account.
- A linked bank account must be unlinked because you want to stop using the bank feed service for the account.
- Online bank accounts have changed and you want to update the information on bank accounts in Project "Madeira".
