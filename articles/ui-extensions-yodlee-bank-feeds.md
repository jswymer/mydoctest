# The Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds Extension to Project "Madeira"
To quickly reconcile payments made to your bank accounts, Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds allows you to link your system bank account to your online bank account. This means that the latest bank statement is automatically or manually fed into your reconciliation journal, ensuring that you are always processing the latest payments with minimal risk of errors. Envestnet Yodlee Bank Feeds offers the ability to link to online bank accounts to import electronic bank statements for use in payment reconciliation.
