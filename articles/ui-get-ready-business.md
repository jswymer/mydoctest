# Getting Ready for Doing Business
Congratulations, you have just set up your first company in Project "Madeira". 

We have prepared some company data for you, for example, your chart of accounts is prefilled with a number of posting accounts ready for use. You can, of course, change the chart of accounts to suit your needs. For more information, see [Set Up Finance](SetUpFinance/conSetUpFinance.md). 

From the Home page, you will find the **Assisted Setup & Tasks** action. Here you see a list of assisted setup that can help you getting started. Once you have migrated data such as vendors, customers, and items from your existing financial system, you are ready to begin. But depending on your needs, consider if the other assisted setup can help you. 

In the **Assisted Setup** window, you will find the following:

|Assisted Setup           |Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Migrate Data             |Lets you import your existing company data from Excel or Quickbooks.|
|Set Up Email             |Gets you ready for sending email messages directly from, for example, sales orders or contacts.|
|Set Up Office Add-Ins    |Sets up the ability to use and launch Project "Madeira" from Outlook 365.|
|Set Up Sales Tax         |Gets you started with default Tax groups and assigning Tax areas.|
|Set Up Approval Workflows |Sets up automatic notifications to approvers when a user makes certain changes in the product.|
|Set Up Email Logging     |Sets up capability to log email correspondance in Project "Madeira".|
  
When you have run an assisted setup, it is marked as **Completed**. To run the assisted setup, you choose the three dots also called the context menu, and then you select **Start Setup**.

## Home
On the Home page, you have an overview of the business. To the left you see a navigation bar that gives you easy access to customers, vendors, items, and so on. In the center you find the **Activities** tiles. **Activities** show current data and can be clicked or tapped for easy access to the selected document. The **Key Performance Indicators** can be set up to display a selected chart for a visual representation of, for example, cash flow or income and expenses. You can also build up a list of **Favorite Customers** on the Home page for accounts that you do business with often or need to pay special attention to. 
Use the arrows to collapse part of the page and make more room to show specific data. At the top of the Home page you will find all of the actions that can be applied to the current content. This too can be collapsed and you only need to click or tap within the collapsed area to view it again. 

## Company Information
Under **Company Settings** you can view and edit setup information about the current company, much of this was prefilled if you completed the **Set Up Company** assisted setup when signing up for Project "Madeira". If you want to change the company logo, contact information, bank settings, or Tax information, you can do it from this page.    

## Creating Users
If you need to add more users, this is done from Office 365, and you should therefore ask your administrator of Office 365 to do this. More information is available here [Add Users to Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-users-to-Office-365-for-business-435ccec3-09dd-4587-9ebd-2f3cad6bc2bc). Once users are created in Office 365, they can be imported using the **Users** card, where you choose the **Get Users from Azure** action.  
    
## Getting Help
In Project "Madeira" you will find tooltips that can help guide you through the various business processes. In each tooltip you will find a link called **Learn More** that takes you to product Help. The question mark in the upper right corner also points you to product Help.
<!-- see madeira.com information here --> 

## Next Steps 
Based on your migrated data, you can now proceed to create new sales or purchase documents. Use the **My Company** section of your **Home** page to quickly create a new sales quote, sales invoice, sales order, purchase invoice or payment registration.
