# Automatically Record Interactions with Contacts
You can set up the application to automatically record interactions for sales, purchase and service documents, cover sheets, e-mails, phone calls, such as:
* Print sales or purchase quotes, orders, invoices, credit memos, cover sheets.
* Create sales service orders.
* Post sales service orders.
* Send e-mails to your contacts.
* Call your contacts, if you have a TAPI-compliant telephone and the right installation.

To set up the automatic recording of these interactions, you specify interaction templates for these documents and actions by using the **Interaction Template Setup** window. To open the **Interaction Template Setup** window, in the **Search** box, enter **Interaction Template Setup**, and then choose the related link.
