# Make Payments
When you make payments to vendors, you post the related payment lines in the **Payment Journal** window. You can use the **Suggest Vendor Payments** function to find payments that are due. You can also use the **Vendor - Summary Aging** report to get an overview of due payments.

From the payment journal, you can print computer checks or record when checks are written. If you select **Computer Check** in the **Bank Payment Type** field, then any lines representing checks must be printed before the payment journal can be posted.

When the payments are posted, you can export them to a bank file for upload to your bank for processing.

After the payments are made at your bank, you must apply them to their related open vendor ledger entries. You can do this manually or by importing a bank statement file and applying the payments automatically. For more information, see, for example, [Apply Payments Automatically and Reconcile Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.md).

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
