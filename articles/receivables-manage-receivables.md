# Manage Receivables#
A regular step in any financial rhythm is to reconcile bank accounts, which requires that you apply payments to customer or vendor ledger entries to close sales invoices and purchase credit memos.  
  
In Financials, one of the fastest ways to register payments from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** window by importing a bank statement file or feed. The payments are applied to open customer or vendor ledger entries based on data matches between payment text and entry information. You can review and change the matches before you post the journal, and close bank account ledger entries for ledger entries when you post the journal. The bank account is reconciled when all payments are applied.

There are, however, other handy places to apply payments and reconcile bank accounts:  
  
- The **Bank Account Reconciliations** window, which also lets you check ledger entries. For more information, see [How to: Reconcile Bank Accounts Separately](bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.md).  
- The **Payment Registration** window, where you can apply and manually check payments received as cash, check, or bank transaction against a generated list of unpaid sales documents. Note that this functionality is available only for sales documents.  
- The **Cash Receipt Journal** window, where you manually post receipts to the relevant general ledger, customer, or other account by entering a payment line. You can either apply the receipt or refund to one or more open entries before you post the cash receipt journal, or from the customer ledger entries.  
  
Another part of managing receivables is to collect outstanding balances, including finance charges, and issue reminders. Financials offers ways to do those things as well. For more information, see [How to: Collect Outstanding Balances](receivables-collect-outstanding-balances.md).
