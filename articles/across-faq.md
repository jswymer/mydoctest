# Frequently Asked Questions
This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about signing up for and using Financials.  

## What email address can I use with Financials?
Financials requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. Financials does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.  

If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up](ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.md).

No. But if you want to experience Financials as fully integrated with Office 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Office 365 [here](https://products.office.com/try).
