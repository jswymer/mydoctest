# Changing Basic Settings
In the **My Settings** window, you can see and change basic settings for Project "Madeira".  

## Role Center
The Role Center represents the Home page, a starting page that is designed for the needs of the role.

The default Role Center is Business Manager, but you can select another Role Center that fits your needs better.

## Company
A company functions as a container for data in Project "Madeira". There can be multiple companies in a database, but only one can be selected at a time.

The CRONUS US company is the default company. It contains demonstration data only.   

## Work date
The default work date is usually today's date. You may have to temporarily change the work date to be able to perform tasks, such as completing transactions for a date that is not the current date.

**Tip**: Type **w** to quickly enter the work date in a date field. Write **t** to quickly enter the current date in the date field.

**Important**: The work date is only changed until you close the company or until the date changes. If you open a different company or open the same company the next day and still have to use a different work date, then you must set the work date again.
