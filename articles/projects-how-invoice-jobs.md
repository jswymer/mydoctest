# How to: Invoice Jobs
During the project, job costs from resource usage, materials, and job-related purchases can accumulate. As the job progresses, these transactions get posted to the job journal. It is important that all costs get recorded in the job journal before you invoice the customer.

You can invoice the whole job from the **Job Task Lines** window or only invoice selected contract lines from the **Planning Lines** window. Invoicing can be done after the job is finished or at certain intervals during the job's progress based on an invoicing schedule.
