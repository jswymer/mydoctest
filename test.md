MICROSOFT PROJECT “Test Begin” PREVIEW
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them.  This agreement applies to the pre-release software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any.  It also applies to any Microsoft
•	updates,
•	supplements,
•	Internet-based services, and
•	support services
for the software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
By installing, having installed, attempting to install, or using the software, you accept this agreement.  If you do not accept this agreement, you may not install, have installed, attempt to install, or use the software.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
  - **Installation and Use.**
    - You may install, test, and evaluate any number of copies of the software on your premises but only in a development or test environment for the software.
    - You may not test the software in a live operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement.
  - **Included Microsoft Programs.** The software contains other Microsoft programs. If separate license terms accompany those components, the license terms with those components apply to them, instead of these license terms.
    - Microsoft SQL Server-branded Components.  The Microsoft Dynamics NAV software is accompanied by Microsoft SQL Server-branded components, which are licensed to you under the terms of the respective SQL Server licenses located in the “Licenses” folder in the software’s installation directory.  If you do not accept the applicable Microsoft SQL Server-branded component license terms, you may not use that component.
    - Microsoft SQL Server Report Builder for Microsoft SQL Server 2014.  The Microsoft Dynamics NAV software is accompanied by Microsoft SQL Server Report Builder 3.0 for Microsoft SQL Server 2014 (Report Builder), which is licensed to you under its own license terms located in the following installation directory for Microsoft Dynamics NAV: Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\90\Setup\Licenses. You may use Report Builder only in conjunction with Microsoft Dynamics NAV.  If you do not accept the Report Builder license terms, you may not use the Report Builder.
    - Microsoft Exchange Web Services Managed API 2.2. The Microsoft Dynamics NAV software is accompanied by Exchange Web Services Managed API 1.2 (EWSMA), which is licensed to you under its own license terms located in the following installation directory for Microsoft Dynamics NAV: Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\90\Setup\Licenses. You may use EWSMA only in conjunction with Microsoft Dynamics NAV.  If you do not accept the EWSMA license terms, you may not use the EWSMA.
    - Microsoft Chart Controls for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.5 for Microsoft Windows Operating Systems. The Microsoft Dynamics NAV software is accompanied by Microsoft Chart Controls for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 for Microsoft Windows Operating Systems (Chart Controls), which is licensed to you under its own license terms located in the following installation directory for Microsoft Dynamics NAV: Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Dynamics NAV\90\Setup\Licenses. You may use Chart Controls only in conjunction with Microsoft Dynamics NAV.  If you do not accept the Chart Controls license terms, you may not use the Chart Controls.
    - Microsoft Report Viewer 2015 Runtime.  The Microsoft Dynamics NAV software is accompanied by Microsoft Report Viewer 2012 Runtime (“Report Viewer”).
    - Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services Map Report Item. Report Viewer may include features that retrieve content such as maps, images and other data through the Bing Maps (or successor branded) application programming interface (the “Bing Maps APIs”). The purpose of these features is to create reports displaying data on top of maps, aerial and hybrid imagery. If these features are included, you may use them to create and view dynamic or static documents. This may be done only in conjunction with and through methods and means of access integrated in the supplement. You may not otherwise copy, store, archive, or create a database of the content available through the Bing Maps APIs. You may not use the following for any purpose even if they are available through the Bing Maps APIs:
      -	Bing Maps APIs to provide sensor based guidance/routing, or
      -	any Road Traffic Data or Bird’s Eye Imagery (or associated metadata).
      - Your use of the Bing Map APIs and associated content is also subject to the additional terms and conditions at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=21969.
2. THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS. The software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement.  Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for your information only.
3.	TERM. The term of this agreement begins when you accept it and ends on November 30, 2016, or commercial release of the software, whichever is first.
4.	PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. This software is a pre-release version.  It may not work the way a final version of the software will.  We may change it for the final, commercial version.  We also may not release a commercial version.
5.	FEEDBACK. Because this is pre-release software, you agree to give feedback about the software to Microsoft.  You give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose.  You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback.  You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to you or third parties because we include your feedback in them.  These rights survive this agreement.
6.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The software, including its user interface, features and documentation, is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers.
  - Use. For five years after installation of the software or its commercial release, whichever is first, you may not disclose confidential information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information only to your employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written agreements with them that protect the confidential information at least as much as this agreement.
  - Survival. Your duty to protect confidential information survives this agreement.
  - Exclusions. You may disclose confidential information in response to a judicial or governmental order. You must first give written notice to Microsoft to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise protect the information. Confidential information does not include information that
    - 	becomes publicly known through no wrongful act;
    - you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality obligations to Microsoft or its suppliers; or
    - you developed independently.
7.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold.  This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.  Microsoft reserves all other rights.  Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.  In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that allow you to use it only in certain ways. You also may not
  - disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software to any third party without Microsoft’s prior written approval;
  - work around any technical limitations in the software;
  - reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
  - make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement, or allowed by applicable law despite this limitation;
  - publish the software for others to copy;
  - distribute, rent, lease or lend the software;
  - transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
  - use the software for commercial software hosting services.
8.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations.  You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.  These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.  For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
9.	SUPPORT SERVICES.  Because the software is “as is,” we have no obligation to provide support services for it under this agreement.  If we elect to provide support services for the software under this agreement, we may stop providing such support services at any time with or without notice.
10.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and any support services.
11.	APPLICABLE LAW.
  - United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
  - Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
12.	LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
13.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.”  You bear the risk of using it.  Microsoft gives no express warranties or guarantees.  You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.  To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes all implied warranties, including without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
FOR AUSTRALIA – You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.
14.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, punitive, or incidental damages.  This limitation applies to
  - anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and  
  - claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

  It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
